Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::Descriptive.

3.0200      June 18, 2010
    - Added skewness and kurtosis
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=58187
        - Thanks to Shawn Laffan.

3.0102      June 15, 2010
    - Add the $VERSION variable to Statistics::Descriptive::Sparse and
    Statistics::Descriptive::Full. This was done to silence the CPAN indexer.

3.0101      June 15, 2010
    - Moved the trimmed_mean caching test (that used the Benchmark.pm module)
    to rejects/descr.t , because it kept failing.

3.0100      July 20, 2009
    - Added the quantile method - thanks to Djibril Ousmanou (DJIBEL).
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47948

3.0000      May 29, 2009
    - Added tests (for ->count, ->sum, ->sumsq, ->min, ->max)
    - Localized the scope of $stat and other variables in t/descr.t
    - Got rid of AUTOLOAD in favour of individual accessors.
    - Converted many direct member accesses to the accessors.
    - Added ->frequency_distribution_ref() which deprecates
      frequency_distribution().
    - Some refactoring of the lib/Statistics/Descriptive.pm module
    (without breaking the documented API).

2.9   May 13, 2009

    - Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46026 :
        - standard_deviation failing due to a variance that got evaluated
        to 0 due to rounding errors.
    - Kwalitee : added a LICENSE section to the POD.
    - Kwalitee (CPANTS) : added an examples/ directory with a script.

2.8   May 09, 2009

    - Enabled "./Build runtest" and "./Build distruntest" (using Test::Run)
    in the distribution.

    - Fixed incomplete/broken tests in t/descr.t.

2.7   May 03, 2009

    - Converted the distribution to Build.PL and re-organized it to
    put everything under its proper place. Started maintaining it in:
        - http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/Statistics-Descriptive/

    - Converted t/descr.t to use "use strict;" and "use warnings;".
    
    - Converted t/descr.t to use Test::More.

    - Cleaned up the "use" statement of lib/Statistics/Descriptive.pm.

    - Added more explicit dependencies (core, though) to Build.PL. 

    - Fixed RT bug #34999: freq distribution generated too many bins.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34999

    - Added some keywords and resources to the META.yml, using Build.PL's
    meta_merge.

    - Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32183 
        - more authoritative (and non-broken) link to the RFC.

    - Applied the patch in https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9160 
        - {{#9160: Variance and Standard Deviation use costly pseudo-variance, 
        instead of computing real variance}}.

2.6   October 10, 2002
    - Fixed caching in trimmed mean and modified code to allow trimming
	  0% from upper bound.  Formerly if 0 was requested then it used the
	  lower bound!

	- POD format patch from ddunlap

2.5   Wednesday, May 12 1999
	- Forgot to document change in v2.4, which included fixing
	  percentile so that it worked right and added to the test
	  harness.
	- Modified frequency_distribution so that specific bins could
	  be passed in.  Fixed caching so that it actually works
	  (it only used to get stuck returning the result of the
	  first call).
	- Turned off caching for least_squares_fit because there's no
	  way to generate a unique key for memorization.

2.3   Thursday Nov 12 1998
	- Fix for frequency distribution.
	  Changed Makefile.PL to ease ActiveState distribution of the module.
	  Andrea's code for preventing division by zero and other 
	  improvements.  He also wrote a great test bench.
	  Added code from Warren Matthews to calculate percentile.

2.2   Monday Feb 23 1998
	- Multiple bug fixes:
	  Fixed min/max bug with '0' vs defined.
	  Provided fix for bug with AUTOLOAD/DESTROY/Carp problem.

2.1   Tues Sep 02 1997
	- Multiple bug fixes:
	  Cleaned up syntax error with my scoping. 
	  Fixed errors in least_squares_fit and median methods

2.00  Wed Aug 20 13:22:51 1997
	- new version; created by h2xs 1.16
	- Complete rewrite of OO interface by Colin Kuskie.
	- Now has 2 classes instead of 1.5, a base class without data
	  storage and a class that inherits the base methods and
	  extends them with data storage and more statistics.

1.1 April 1995
        - Added LeastSquaresFit and FrequencyDistribution.

1.0 March 1995 
        - Released to comp.lang.perl and placed on archive sites.

0.20 December 1994 
        - Complete rewrite after extensive and invaluable e-mail 
          correspondence with Anno Siegel.

0.10 December 1994 
        - Initital concept, released to perl5-porters list.
	- Jason Kastner <jkastner@tuba.aix.calpoly.edu>
