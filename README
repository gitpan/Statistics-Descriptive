This new version (2.2) of Statistics::Descriptive contains:

- A bug fix for the calculation of min and max.  Thanks to Thomas Goetze
  for alerting me to this (and supplying a solution).

- A bug fix for a strange bug when using AUTOLOAD and Carp.  Actually,
  I benefitted from the bug.  If you use the AUTOLOAD from the perltoot
  manpage and use Carp to provide "nice" error trapping from the module,
  then the AUTOLOAD doesn't catch calls to DESTROY (which it is supposed
  to do, technically).  If you use warn, then it catches the call to
  DESTROY and prints the error message 'Unable to access method DESTROY
  in class Statistics::Descriptive'.

  Thanks to Terrence Brannon for alerting me to this.  He, running
  perl5.003_07, has the AUTOLOAD method intermittently catch the
  call even when Carp is being used.  Go figure...

List of methods by class:

Statistics::Descriptive::Sparse
----------------------------------
add_data
count
mean
sum
variance
pseudo_variance
min
max
mindex
maxdex
standard_deviation
sample_range

Statistics::Descriptive::Full
----------------------------------
All methods above and:
get_data
sort_data
presorted
median
trimmed_mean
harmonic_mean
mode
geometric_mean
frequency_distribution
least_squares_fit

Ideas for ongoing development:

- An interface to Jon Orwant's Statistics::ChiSquare module to
  provide a method for determining how random data is (for a uniform
  distribution) or how well is fits another distribution (for
  non-uniform distributions like normal(gaussian), log-normal,
  rayleigh, etc).

  The major issue I'm concerned about is the updating of someone else's
  code and future extensibility.  Now, major paranoia should be obvious
  since Jon hasn't changed Statistics::ChiSquare for a long, long
  time.  Still, a wrapper module that inherits from several other
  modules is appealing.  Perhaps it will be called Statistics::Bundle.
